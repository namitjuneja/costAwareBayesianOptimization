Convert the cost model gp regression from functional to object oriented

the evaluate_f and evaluate_cost return singletons of different shapes [n,1] and [n] respectively
this is because i think botorh gp and gpytorch gp takes input in different formats. fix this later



cost model debugging thoughts

the cost model designed is not very good. it monotonically increases with nnodes
but what about others
